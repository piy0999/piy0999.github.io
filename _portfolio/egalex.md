projectdescription: " Law firms already do pro bono work but many times they find it hard to find cases or underprivileged people find it hard to reach these firms. </br>

We wanted to connect these two but in a way which is convenient and easy for both without us being the middlemen. The idea was to create a healthy competition between law firms. Like a sports competition but for CSR. Every two months rankings would be updated to see who's doing the most CSR work. A system like this requires somebody to organize all this so it's expensive time and money wise. We thought we can use automation to organize this and blockchain to make this cheap and decentralized. </br>

All the law firm has to do is to just keep up a node in a private network of law firms. Any law firm can add or take cases to/from the network based on their demand/supply through a convenient web app. </br>

Moreover, underprivileged people can also add their case to the network through a mobile app in which they just have to voice record their story. </br>

To process this audio, we created an in-house speech-to-text model. After transcribing the story we push the person's ask for help to the network with a summary of his story and contact details. We did it for English to English but this could work for any language so it's really useful for people like refugees. "
teamdesc: The project was developed by a team of 3 in January 2018 for Global Legal Hackathon
technology_stack: 
  - Ethereum Private Blockchain Network
  - LSTM machine learning model based on Keras to transcribe speech to text
  - Azure Virtual Machines for blockchain network 
  - Azure Batch AI used for training the model
  - React Native Mobile App & React based Web App
