projectdescription: "Chairman aims at solving the basic problems for finding a space in public facilities. This project implements the concept for student libraries where we use live video from the libraries to identify how many seats are empty and which section fo the library is emptier. All this live information can be simply accessed using a web app so that a student can conveniently find a seat without wasting any time"
teamdesc: The project was developed by a team of 4 within 24 hours for HackUST (Hong Kong University of Science & Technology Hackathon)
technology_stack: 
  - Keras Implementation of Retina Net Object Detection (Region based Convolutional Neural Network approach) 
  - Javascript and Bootstrap based web & mobile compatible app
  - Azure Batch AI used for training the model
