projectdescription: "Parity connects lawyers taking pro-bono cases directly with the underpriviledged through a simple mobile app. </br>
The user can submit a case just by talking about it in any of the 60 supported languages, our transcription and speech to text model converts the description given by the user and lodges a case in our dashboard with basic information about the case. Interested lawyers can then contact the user directly through the contact details provided by the user if the lawyers are willing to take the case. This reduces time to find a lawyer and also makes it easier to find lawyers genuinely willing to take up the pro-bono work. 
"
teamdesc: The project was developed by a team of 4 within 24 hours for Access to Justice Hackathon (A2J Legal Hack)
